        <h2 class="page-header">News</h2>
        <p>Over the past few months you would have seen increased activity at the club, such as additional NSO training,
            new member training, long gun side matches, the 5x5 classifier on more regular basis and a few more. This is
            done to broaden the offering to the club members. Additionally, there is an ongoing interaction with
            potential ranges that may host us in the future.</p>
        <p>To make this a sustainable effort, and assist growing the club activities more (especially with interaction
            with ranges), the club is requiring assistance from the members. We have received some assistance on an
            ongoing basis, but more structured assistance will be required. Take note, that by volunteering your time on
            the activities below does not require you to be formally part of any committee and can be on an ad-hoc basis
            with the coordinating exco member.</p>


        <p> We require assistance with any of the following. Should you be able to provide other assistance, also let
            the relevant exco member know:<br>

            <b>Match day (Barbara/Danie)</b> â€“ either monthly or when willing<br>

            <b>Match Directors</b> (anyone can assist with arranging the match, if not a SO, guidance will be provided and a SO will be match day MD)<br>
            <b>Designing of CoFs</b> (can continuously be sent through for building of a CoF database)<br>
            <b>Range Building</b><br>
            <b>Range Breakdown</b> (this is a very important point where assistance is required)<br>
            <b>Match Registration/administration</b><br>
            <b>Running the long gun side match</b><br>
            <b>Running 5x5 classifiers on a monthly basis</b><br>
            <b>Training (Marius)</b><br>
            <b>Running or assisting with NSOs</b><br>
            <b>Member training/mentoring</b><br>
            <b>Logistics (Chris)</b><br>
            <b>Keeping the container organised</b><br>
            <b>Organising and maintaining consumable stocks (targets, patches etc)</b><br>
            <b>Maintenance of current equipment</b><br>
            <b>Production of new equipment</b><br>

            Should you be willing to assist with any of the above, or any other area where you feel you can be of
            assistance, kindly contact the relevant exco members (or you can contact <a href="mailto:matchadmin@cdpc.co.za?subject=Member Assistance">matchadmin@cdpc.co.za</a> and I will
            forward the email).
        </p>

        <p> We are also working on an incentive system going forward and it will be communicated once completed.
            We are striving in enhancing the club experience and thank everyone that does provide assistance.
        </p>
        Regards

        CDPC Exco
